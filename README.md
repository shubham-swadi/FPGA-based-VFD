### FPGA-Based Variable Frequency Drive (VFD)

This project implements a Variable Frequency Drive using the Basys 3 FPGA board to control the speed of an induction motor. Unlike traditional microcontroller-based solutions, this design leverages FPGAâ€™s parallel processing capabilities for precise and efficient motor control.

Key features:

* **Open-loop V/f control** strategy for speed regulation.
* **Sinusoidal PWM (SPWM)** for smooth voltage and frequency output.
* **Improved performance** over microcontrollers in generating high-frequency PWM and handling real-time tasks.

The system demonstrates how FPGAs offer customizable, high-performance motor control for modern industrial applications like fans, pumps, and conveyor systems.
